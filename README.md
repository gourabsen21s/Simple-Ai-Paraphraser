🌟 AI Paraphraser

Welcome to the **AI Paraphraser** project! 🚀 This application leverages the power of generative AI to paraphrase text. Users can input text, which is processed by a backend service, returning a paraphrased version in real time. Plus, you can see the total word count as you type! ✍️

🎉 Features

- **Real-time Word Count**: Keep track of your word count while typing! 📝
- **AI-Driven Paraphrasing**: Get instant paraphrased text with state-of-the-art AI. 🤖
- **Model Flexibility**: Easily switch or fine-tune AI models to suit your needs. 🔄

📋 Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher 🐍
- Node.js 🌐
- Flask 🚀
- Transformers library (for AI model) 📦

⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-paraphraser.git
   cd ai-paraphraser
   ```

2. **Set Up the Python Environment**:

   Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install flask transformers
   ```

3. **Set Up the Node.js Environment**:

   Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required packages:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

## 🚀 Running the Application

1. **Start the Python Flask Backend**:

   In the root directory of the project, run:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will start the Flask server on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

2. **Start the Node.js Server**:

   Open a new terminal window, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and run:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   This will start the Node.js server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. **Open the Application**:

   Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the application. 🌍

## 🔧 Fine-tuning or Changing the AI Model

By default, the application uses a specific AI model for paraphrasing. If you want to fine-tune the AI model or use another one, follow these steps:

1. Open the `app.py` file in the root directory.
2. Locate the line where the model is instantiated:

   ```python
   model_name = "your-default-model-name"
   ```

3. Replace `"your-default-model-name"` with the name of the model you wish to use (e.g., `"t5-small"`, `"gpt-neo"`, etc.). 🛠️
4. Ensure you have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed for the new model.
