Sure! Hereâ€™s a sample `README.md` file for your project that includes instructions on how to set up the project, run it, and information about fine-tuning or changing the AI model.

# AI Paraphraser

This project implements an AI-powered paraphraser using a generative AI model. The application takes input text, sends it to a backend service, and returns a paraphrased version of the text in real time. Users can type text into the input area, and the application will display the total word count while processing the input.

## Features

- Real-time word count while typing.
- AI-driven paraphrasing of input text.
- Easy to integrate with different AI models.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Node.js
- Flask
- Transformers library (for AI model)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-paraphraser.git
   cd ai-paraphraser
   ```

2. **Set up the Python environment:**

   Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install flask transformers
   ```

3. **Set up the Node.js environment:**

   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required packages:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Python Flask backend:**

   In the root directory of the project, run:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will start the Flask server on `http://localhost:8000`.

2. **Start the Node.js server:**

   Open a new terminal window, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and run:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   This will start the Node.js server on `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Open the Application:**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Fine-tuning or Changing the AI Model

By default, the application uses a specific AI model for paraphrasing. If you want to fine-tune the AI model or use another model, follow these steps:

1. Open the `app.py` file in the root directory.
2. Locate the line where the model is instantiated:

   ```python
   model_name = "your-default-model-name"
   ```

3. Replace `"your-default-model-name"` with the name of the model you wish to use (e.g., `"t5-small"`, `"gpt-neo"`, etc.).

4. Ensure that you have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed for the new model.

### Notes:
- Replace `yourusername` in the clone command with your actual GitHub username.
- Change the model name in the instructions as per your project's requirements.
- Update the contact email address at the bottom.
- Adjust any other sections based on your project specifics, such as additional features or requirements.

This `README.md` provides a comprehensive guide for users to understand, install, and run your project while also allowing them to customize the AI model used in the application.
